Dear School Community:


It has come to our attention that some schools are implementing COVID-19 contact tracing app, where users are required to grant the app permission to their GPS location at all times. We believe that this is against the students’ privacy rights and we will not engage with the contact tracing program.


However, we still highly prioritize the students’ health and wellbeing and hope that they can stay in school as long as possible without being disrupted by the highly contagious nature of COVID-19. We encourage students to be honest and immediately communicative if they do test positive, or even if they feel any symptoms, as an act of precaution. [a]


Instead of using location based contact tracing, we will…
* Use location based cards that students wear during the school day only
* OR
* Schedule/class based contact tracing. If a student tests positive, we will notify anyone who shared a classroom with them that they were exposed.




In community,
