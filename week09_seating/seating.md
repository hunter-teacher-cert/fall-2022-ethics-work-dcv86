The only way to fully combat this problem would be to remove the profit incentive of airlines to upcharge consumers who wish to choose their seats. I have very few requirements when flying (unlike people with small children or a disability); however, I am pretty tall, and the legroom is constantly shrinking because of cash grabs from the airlines. So if we're not confronting the main issue but rather tweaking an already broken system, I think the most sensible thing to do would be to divide the plane into sections (no more first class) and sell the tickets based on their needs. Need four seats together because of someone's crippling fear of flying? No problem. Have two small children? Great. You get four seats together. Everyone who can sit apart can sit in the general seating. If people want to sit together without needing accommodations, then we can group based on party sizes. If we're following this line of thinking, perhaps using the first come, first serve model will work best -- keeping the "single" seat placement flexible to accommodate those in need. Anyhow, people over profits.
